üìù Simple CRUD App with MongoDB

This is a basic full-stack CRUD application that connects to a MongoDB database. It allows users to:

    Create: Submit a form to add new items to the database.

    Read: Retrieve and display all items in a <ul> list.

    Update: Edit individual <li> elements directly from the list.

    Delete: Remove specific <li> items from the list.

The app uses Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for backend operations and vanilla HTML/CSS/JS on the frontend.
